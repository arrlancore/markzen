# MarkZen Kanban Bookmark Management

## Overview

MarkZen's Kanban-style bookmark management transforms how you organize your web resources. Instead of the traditional hierarchical folder structure found in most browsers, MarkZen presents your bookmarks as cards on a flexible Kanban board with customizable columns. This visual approach makes it easy to categorize, prioritize, and access your important web resources at a glance.

## Key Features

- **Visual Organization**: Arrange bookmarks as cards across customizable columns (like "To Read", "Reference", "Tools", or any categories that suit your workflow)
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Effortlessly move bookmarks between columns as your needs change
- **Rich Bookmark Cards**: Each bookmark displays its title, URL, favicon, description, and custom tags for enhanced context
- **Workspace Management**: Create multiple workspaces to separate different contexts (work, personal, projects) with their own unique column arrangements
- **Quick Access**: Add the current page to your bookmarks with one click via the extension's popup
- **Fast Search & Filtering**: Quickly find bookmarks across all workspaces with powerful search and filtering options [TODO]
- **Usage Analytics**: Automatically track which bookmarks you use most frequently to surface your most valuable resources

The Kanban approach is particularly effective for knowledge workers, researchers, and anyone who needs to manage large collections of web resources in a visual, intuitive way. By organizing bookmarks spatially rather than hierarchically, MarkZen helps you maintain context and priority while reducing the cognitive load of finding the resources you need.
